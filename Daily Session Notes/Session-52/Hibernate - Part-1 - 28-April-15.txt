ValueStack and OGNL
-------------------
The value stack is a set of several objects

ValueStack stack = ActionContent.getContext().getValueStack();

OGNL Stands for Object Graph Navigation Language is a expression language which is used to reference and manipulate data on value stack

Refer programs

 - OGNLAction.java
 - ognl.jsp
 - HelloWorld1.jsp
 - struts.xml


Hibernate
---------
Hibernate is an ORM Framework

ORM Stands for Object Relational Mapping

Refer diagram ORM.png

Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from java classes to database tables but also provides data query(HQL) and retrival facilities

Cons of JDBC
------------
- Complex if it is used large projects
- No encapsulation
- Query is DBMS Specific

Advantages of ORM 
-----------------
- lets business code access objects rather than DB tables
- Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic
- Based on JDBC 'under the hood'
- Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure
- Transaction Management and automatic key generation
- Fast development of application

Java ORM Frameworks
-------------------
- Hibernate
- EJB Entity Beans (replaced with JPA)
- Java Data Objects
- Castor
- TopLink
- JBatics

Hibernate Introduction
----------------------
Hibernate is a ORM framework created by Gavin King in 2001.

Hibernate sits between Java Objects and data base server

Hibernate Advantages
--------------------
- Hibernate takes care of mapping Java classes to database tables using XML files and without writing any line of code
- Provides simple APIs for storing and retrieving Java Objects directly to and from the data base
- If there is change in Database or in any table then the only need to change XML file properties
- Hibernate does not require any server to operate
- Associations are simple by using hiberate

Hibernate Architecture
----------------------
Refer digram Hibernate Architecture.png

Refer diagram Detailed Hibernate Architecture.png

Steps in Hibernate Application
-------------------------------
- Create Configuration Object
- Configure the Hibernate properties file (Hibernate Configuration file) using Configuration object
- Build SessionFactory using configuration object
- Open Session using SessionFactory object
- Begin Transaction using Session object
- Create object for POJO class
- Save the object using Session object
- Commit the trasaction
- Close the Session
