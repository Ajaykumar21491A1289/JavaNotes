Developing a Java Application at command prompt
-----------------------------------------------
- Open command prompt by typing cmd in start->Run
     c:\>d:
     d:\>
- Create a folder/directory "JavaPrograms" as follows
    d:\>md JavaPrograms
    md make directory
- Change the folder to "JavaPrograms" as follows
    d:\>cd JavaPrograms
    d:\JavaPrograms>
- Set the path to JAVA_HOME\bin folder
   d:\JavaPrograms>set path=D:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin;%path%;
   %path% means appending previous path setting
- Create a file Welcome.java as follows
   d:\JavaPrograms>notepad Welcome.java
- Type the following code in Welcome.java
 //to display Welcome message onto the screen
  class Welcome
  {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
	System.out.println("Welcome");	
    }
  }
  Note:Save the file (ctrl+s)
- Compile Welcome.java as follows
   d:\JavaPrograms>javac Welcome.java
    creates a file Welcome.class (bytecode)
- Run Welcome.class as follows
    d:\JavaPrograms>java Welcome
   will displays "Welcome" message onto the screen

Setting path permanently
-------------------------
Right Click on Computer->Properties ->Click on Advanced System Settings
->Click on Environment Variables->Click on New

   Variable Name : path
   Variable Value : D:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin

Click Ok

Explanation of First Java Program
---------------------------------
1. //to display Welcome message onto the screen
2.  class Welcome
3.  {
4.    public static void main(String[] args)
5.    {
6.	System.out.println("Welcome");	
7.    }
8.  }

Line 1 :is a comment line - comments are ignored by compiler
Line 2 :is a class Welcome - in java everything should be in the form          of classes
Line 4:
-------
main() is the entry point to run Java program

JVM : JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine which acts as an interface between java byte code and operating system. When a Java program is executed JVM looks for the main() to start executing the program.

public: public members are accessible outside the class
Since JVM is outside the class Welcome, to access main() by JVM,main() should be public

static: static members are accessible directly with the class name without creating objects
  >java Welcome.main()

void: void means no return type. main() is void since main() does not return anything back to JVM

String[] args
-------------
- String is a predefined class in Java
- String[] args is used to store command line arguments
    eg:
     >java Welcome x y z

    x y z are command line arguments

   args[0] -> x, args[1] -> y, args[2] -> z

Line 6:
-------
System.out.println()
-------------------
It is used to display messages or the value of variables or both onto the screen

System: It is predefined class in Java
out : out is a data member of System class and it is an object of PrintStream class and it is static
println(): It is method of PrintStream class

class System
{
    static PrintStream out;
    ...
}
class PrintStream
{
   void println(){}
}

Write a Program (WAP) to find sum of two numbers using command line arguments

Refer program Sum.java

Scanner class
-------------
- Scanner class is used to read values into variables from keyboard during program execution (runtime)
- Scanner class is added in Java 5 version
- Scanner class is present in java.util package
	import java.util.Scanner;
- Creating Object of Scanner class
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

Methods of Scanner class
------------------------
- nextInt() - used to read an int value
- nextFloat() - used to read a float value
- nextDouble() - used to read a double value
- next() - used to read a String value without spaces
- nextLine() - used to read a String value with spaces

eg:
int n = in.nextInt();
double d = in.nextDouble();
String s = in.next();

WAP to accept rollno, name and marks in 3 subjects. Find total and average. Display rollno, name, total and average

Refer program Student.java

Task:
-----
WAP to accept itemno, item name, rate and quantity. 
Find price (rate*qty). Display itemno, item name and price
