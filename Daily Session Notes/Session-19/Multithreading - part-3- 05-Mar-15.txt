Synchronization
---------------
Refer the diagram Synchronization.png

- When two or more threads access the same resource then their is a chance of getting concurrancy problems
- Synchronization in Java is used to avoid concurrancy problems
- "synchronized" keyword is used for synchronization
- synchronized keyword can be used for a method or block of statements
  eg:
  void xxx()
  {
   ..
   ...
   synchronized(this)
   {
      ...
      ...
      
   }
   ..
   ...
  }

Inter thread communication
--------------------------
- It is done using wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods
- These methods belongs to Object class
- These methods need to be used in Synchronized context only else it will throw IllegalMonitorStateException
- When wait() is invoked on a thread, the other threads will go to the blocked state. Not the calling thread.
- notify() and notifyAll() is used to make the threads to come back to runnable state which are in block state.

Refer program InterThreadDemo.java

Deadlock
--------
If a thread is waiting for the resourse for longer period of time leads to deadlock
