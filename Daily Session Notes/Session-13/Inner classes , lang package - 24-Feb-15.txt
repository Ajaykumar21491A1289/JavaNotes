Inner classes
-------------
A class with in a class is called as inner class
Inner classes are used to have more encapsulation (security)

Types
-----
- Regular inner class
- Method local inner class
- static inner class
- Anonymous inner class

Regular inner class
-------------------
eg:
class Outer
{
   class Inner
   {
     ....
   }
}

Refer program InnerDemo1.java

Method local inner class
------------------------
Inner class is created within a method of outer class
eg:
class Outer
{
   void doStuff()
   {
	class Inner
	{
	  ..
        }
   }
}
The object of inner class is created with in the method

Refer program InnerDemo2.java

static inner class
------------------
If the inner class is static

eg:
class Outer
{
   static class Inner
   {
	...
   }
}
The object of static inner class is created without using the object of outer class
Refer program InnerDemo3.java

Anonymous Inner class
----------------------
No name to the inner class

Refer program InnerDemo4.java

java.lang package
-----------------
- java.lang package is imported to all java programs implicitly

Classes
-------
- Object
- String
- StringBuffer
- StringBuilder
- System
Wrapper classes
---------------
- Byte
- Short
- Character
- Integer
- Long
- Float
- Double
- Boolean

Object class
------------
- Object class is the top most class sitting in Java Hierarchy means any class in Java is a sub class of Object class
- Object class is also known as Cosmic super class

11 Methods in Object class
--------------------------
1. clone()
     - used to create a duplicate object
	eg:
	Emp e = new Emp();
	Emp e1 = e.clone();
2. equals()
     - used to compare the hashcodes of two objects
	eg:
	SOP(e.equals(e1));//true
3. finalize()
     - used to do the cleanup operations like closing of files,        Database connections
     - finalize() is called just proir to the garbage collection
	eg:
	public void finalize()
	{
	    out.close();
	    con.close();
	}
4. getClass()
	- used to return the class name of an object
	eg:
	SOP(e.getClass());//Emp
5. hashCode()
	- used to return the hash code of an object
	eg:
	SOP(e.hashCode());//6564534
6. toString()
	- returns the class name of object along with hashcode
	- used to represent an object in String format
	Refer program ToStringDemo.java
7. wait()
8. wait(long)
9. wait(long,int)
10. notify()
11. notifyAll()

String class
------------
- A String is a collection of characters
- In Java String is immutable (like a constant)
