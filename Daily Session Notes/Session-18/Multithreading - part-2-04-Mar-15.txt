----------------
Multiple threads in a program
-----------------------------
Refer program ThreadDemo2.java

Note:
----
- If start() is invoked multiple times on a thread, then it throws 
IllegalThreadStateException
- If an exception occurs during runtime, it terminates the thread not the program
join()
------
- join() is used between parent thread and child thread
- When join() is invoked on a thread, then until this thread completes the run() the other threads will not use cpu resource.

yield()
-------
- When yield() is called on a thread, then it will give a chance to other thread with the same priority to use cpu resource
- If there is not thread with same priority, then the current thread will continue using the cpu resource
