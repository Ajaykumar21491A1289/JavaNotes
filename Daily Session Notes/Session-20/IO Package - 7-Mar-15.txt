Stream : A stream is a flow of data 

Types of Streams
----------------
- byte streams
- character streams


Refer diagram IOStreams.png

- The top most abstract class under byte stream are InputStream and OutputStream
- The top most abstract classes under character stream are Reader and Writer

Sub classes of InputStream
--------------------------
- FileInputStream 
   - used to open an exiting file and reads the data from the file
- BufferedInputStream
   - used to increase the performance of read operations
- DataInputStream
   - used to read different type of data from the file
- ObjectInputStream
   - used to read an object from the data file

Sub classes of OutputStream
---------------------------
- FileOutputStream
   - used to create a file and writes data onto the file
- BufferedOutputStream
   - used to increase performance of write operations
- DataOutputStream
   - used to write different type of data onto the data files
- ObjectOutputStream
   - used to write an object onto the data file

Sub classes of Reader
---------------------
- FileReader
    - used to open an exising file and read data from the file
- BufferedReader
    - used to increase the performance of read operations

Sub classes of Writer
---------------------
- FileWriter
    - used to create a file and write data onto the file
- BufferedWriter
    - used to increase the performance of write operations

Serialization
-------------
- The process of writing an object onto the data file is called as Serialization
- The process of reading an object from the data file is called as deserialization
- In order to serialize an object of a class, the class should implement Serializable interface else it will throw NotSerializableException
- Serializable interface is a marker interface
- Marker interface does not contain any methods
   eg:
   Serializable
   Clonable
   Remote

Refer program SerializationDemo.java
