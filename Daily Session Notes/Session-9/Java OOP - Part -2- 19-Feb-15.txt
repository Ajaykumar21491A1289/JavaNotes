static keyword
--------------
- static keyword can be used for a variable (data member),method and inner class
- static keyword cannot be used for a top level class
- static keyword cannot be used for a local variable
- static members are accessible directly with the class name without creating objects. Objects can also access static members
- static variable acts as a global variable with in class means all objects of the class can share static variable memory
- A static method can access only other static members directly
-when a new object is created it will create memory only for non-static variables not for static variables.
Refer program StaticDemo.java

Inheritance
-----------
- Creating a new class from an existing class is called as inheritance
- In Java "extends" keyword is used to create a new class from an existing class
   eg:
   class Vehicle //Base or super or parent class
   {
	
   }
   class Car extends Vehicle //Derived or sub or child class
   {

   }
- Through inheritance we acheive reusability of the code
- Java does not support multiple inheritance due to ambiguites
eg:
Vehicle(Car,Bus,Bike)
Furniture(Table,Chair)
Fruit (Apple,Grape)
Account(SavingAccount,CurrentAccount)

- Inheritance is "is-a" relationship

has-a relationship
------------------
class Dept
{
   Emp e;
   ...
}
class Emp
{}

Dept has Emp

- Refer InheritanceDemo1.java
