XML
---
- XML stands for Extensible Markup Language
- XML is used to transport the data from one application to another application
- XML is used to create configuration files

HTML vs XML
-----------
- In HTML all tags are predefined where as in XML all tags are user defined
- HTML is used to present the data where as XML is used to say about the data (METADATA)
	eg:
	<b>xxx</b>  -- HTML (bold)
	<salary>5000</salary> -- XML 
- HTML is not case sensitive where as XML is case sensitive
- HTML is not standard where as XML is standard


Valid XML
---------
An XML document can be a valid XML when it follows the following rules

-> An XML file should contain a root tag and only one root tag
-> For every XML tag there should be a closing tag or should be self enclosing tag
	eg:
	<mytag>....</mytag>
	or
	<mytag/> -- self enclosing
-> Attribute values should be in either " " or ' ' 
	eg:
	<mytag att1 = "value1">...</mytag>
	   or
	<mytag att1 = 'value1'>...</mytag>
-> No overlapping of tags
	eg:
	<b><i>xxx</b></i> //overlapping tag
        <b><i>xxx</i></b> //valid
