When we run a Servlet in eclipse, it opens the following url

http://localhost:8080/WebProj/WelcomeServlet

http: -> protocal

localhost -> tomcat server is present in the same machine
8080 -> port no where tomcat server is running
WebProj -> Project Name (Web Application)
WelcomeServlet -> url pattern

When we make a request to a servlet, first it loads a file called as web.xml present in Web Application (WebProj)

web.xml file is called as deployment descriptor/configuration file

web.xml
-------
<web-app> <!-- root tag -->
   <servlet>
      <servlet-name>Welcome</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>WelcomeServlet</servlet-class>
   </servlet>
   <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>Welcome</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/wel</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>

url :http://localhost:8080/WebProj/wel

Note:
-----
In a Web application we can have only one web.xml file.

Location of web.xml in WebProj
------------------------------
WebProj->WebContent->WEB-INF->web.xml

Including HTML code in Servlets/Sending response in the form HTML
-----------------------------------------------------------------
response.setContent("text/html") method is used to send the response in the form of HTML to the client browser
