Handling exceptions in JSP
--------------------------
If an exception occurs in a JSP page, it is handled by another JSP page called as error page

Refer programs error.html, ErrorPage.jsp, ShowErrors.jsp

Action Tags

<jsp:include> vs <jsp:forward>
------------------------------
In case of <jsp:include> the response is handled by all the pages where as in case of <jsp:forward> the response is handled only by last page

Using JavaBeans in JSP
----------------------
JavaBean
--------
JavaBean is a class with private properties and public setter and getter methods for every property

eg:
public class Book
{
   private int bno;
   private String bname;
   private double price;
   public void setBno(int bno)
   {
	this.bno=bno;
   }
   public void getBno()
   {
	return bno;
   }
   public void setBname(String s)
   {
	this.bname = bname;
   }
   public String getBname()
   {
	return bname;
   }
   public void setPrice(double price)
   {
	this.price = price;
   }
   public void getPrice()
   {
	return price;
   }
}
