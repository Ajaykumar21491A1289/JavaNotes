Packages
--------
- A package is a collection of related classes and interfaces(.class files)
- package keyword is used to create a package
   eg:
   package mypack;
- package statement should be the first statement in the source code file
    eg:
    X.java
    ------
    package mypack;
    import ...
    import ...
    class A{}
    class B{}

- In a source code file we can have only one package statement
- The classes under the package are stored in a folder whose name is same as the package name
- Only public class/members(*) are accessible outside the package
- To use the classes of one package into another we need to import the package
   eg:
   import mypack.A;
   import mypack.B;
     or
   import mypack.*;//* indicates all classes
