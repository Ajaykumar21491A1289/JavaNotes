OO Concepts
-------------
- Objects
- Classes
- Data Abstraction
- Data Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Java
----
- Java is an object oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now merged with Oracle Corp)

Java Features (Buzzwords)
-------------
1. Simple
	- lots of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)/libraries
     eg:
    	sort(n)
2. Object Oriented
3. Robust (Strong) - Exception Handling
4. Platform Independent
      - A Java program can run on any platform (OS)
      - A Java program is a collection of classes
	eg:
	X.java
	------
	class A
	{
	   main(){}
        }
	class B
	{
	   main(){}
        }
	
	To Compile
	----------
	>javac X.java
	   - A.class
           - B.class
         These .class file are called as byte codes
	These byte codes are platform independent

       - To run a Java program atleast one class should contain 
 	  the main()
	To Run
	------
	  >java A - runs from A class main()
	  >java B - runs from B class main()
5. Interpreted - java command is an interpreter
6. Portable
	- since the size of all data types is same on all platforms
7. Secure - No Pointers in Java as pointers violate security
8. Multithread
	- A thread a light weight process under execution with in 
	  a process
	- Multithreading is used to increase the performance of
	  application
9. Dynamic 
	- In Java the memory allocation for arrays, Strings or any
	  object is done during runtime (dynamic)
10. Distributed
